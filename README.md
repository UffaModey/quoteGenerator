# quoteGenerator
This project uses AWS Lambda, EventBridge, and OpenAI‚Äôs API to generate motivational quotes automatically on a schedule (like every morning). The Lambda function is containerized and deployed using Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry).

## üîß What It Does
- Uses a Python Lambda function to call the OpenAI Chat API and generate a motivational quote.
- Schedules the function to run at specific times using AWS EventBridge.
- Logs each quote to AWS CloudWatch Logs.
- Entirely serverless and fits within AWS free tier (if used reasonably).

## üß± Tech Used

- **Python 3.11** ‚Äì Used to write the Lambda function that sends a prompt to OpenAI and processes the response.
- **AWS Lambda (Container Image)** ‚Äì Runs the function code inside a Docker container deployed to AWS.
- **Amazon ECR** ‚Äì Stores the Docker container image that was built locally and used to deploy the Lambda function.
- **EventBridge (Cloud Scheduler)** ‚Äì Triggers the Lambda function automatically on a set schedule (e.g., daily at 9 AM).
- **OpenAI GPT API** ‚Äì Generates the motivational quote by responding to a custom prompt using OpenAI's language model.
- **CloudWatch Logs** ‚Äì Captures and displays logs from each Lambda run so you can see the generated quote and debug if needed.
